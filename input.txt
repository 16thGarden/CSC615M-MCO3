Guild > [VIP+] MaxCraftDu51 [MANIAC]: i got 1.25m wheat and i'm at 100
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: if there was no limit u could just keep going up and up gradually
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: yeah which i thought was the point of it
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: reward the grind
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Well They probably did not think people would reach 100 easily
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: It is my first crop at 100
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: its the only crop u will get to 100
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: the others are not as easy im afraid
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Are there more crops where pests actually boost performance?
Guild > [VIP+] MaxCraftDu51 [MANIAC]: not really
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: but it probably explains Why getting diamond in wheat was always hard for me and easy in other crops
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: cactus maybe
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: pumkin
Guild > [MVP+] Thyla [EGG]: is chimV dae axe better for cane or maxed hoe
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: What is your persoanl best in cactus?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: cane hoe
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: I feel like I should improve my cactus farm by a complete redesign
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: For all crops there specific farming instrument is by far best
Guild > [MVP+] Thyla [EGG]: mushroom?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: not for mushroom
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Not?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: nah
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: dae axe is beter
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: What is you best for mushroom?
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: 486287 with fungi cutter
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: if you got ded 4 fungi cutter might just barely be better
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: tYes I have dedi IV
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: on all tools
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: i dont bc librarian is an s hole
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: and rhino wont shot up
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Actually my fungi cutter is bountiful which is not best for numbers
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: But going diamond anyway
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: With at least 25% over diamond limit
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: what is your crop milestone on mushroom?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: ok wait no nvm
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: chimera 5 daed axe better for farming mushrooms lol
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: fungi cutter always worse than dae axe
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: i just did the math
Guild > [MVP+] Thyla [EGG]:                           Earthworm XIV ? XV
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: 35 is my crop milestone for mushroom
Guild > [MVP+] Thyla [EGG]: all done

Guild > [MVP+] Thyla [EGG]: be
Guild > [MVP+] Thyla [EGG]: got all pest be max
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: i am currently on that
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: I do not have all pests max yet
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: cycling the stereo till i got all maxed then put it on fly and never touch it again
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: tBut getting close
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: tYou think fly always best? Bot trying to get books or so
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Checking elitbot now... I was number 1 in pumpkin recently I see
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: congratulations
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Like in week 25-8 to 30-8
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: And number 2 in mushroom this week
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Actually pretty often number 2 on mushroom.... I really doubt dae axe is better then
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: it is better but no one farms mushrooms
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: cause it is soooo pointless
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Why pointless?
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: cause why would u need to ever farm mushrooms
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: farming all other crops with cow gets u to max milestone
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Yeah thats true But cow really does good job on shroom
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: And looking at number of competitors it is not true that no-one does it
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: u idiot lol
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: everyone is competing in it if they have mooshroom
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Very few people have chim v dae axe for sure
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: u can be farming carrot and ur competing in mushroom
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: I think it only lists the people which show they are in competition... So yeah if carrot is not in the current jacobs you are right
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: i probably have like 50 silvers in mushroom and ive never competed in it properly
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: I have many diamonds in it
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: its probably the easiest to get diamond in
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: cause of the amount of people that compete without competing
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: If you have mooshroom cow and high MP yes... otherwise no
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: u also compete if u fish agaarmoos
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: ur a fool
Guild > [MVP+] lingbeek [HYDRA]: Gonna skip a jacobs and offline...

Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: literally every iron man is farming main not by choice
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: mining is better for money especially on ironman
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: and yet the setup is WAY more expensive
Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: farming with finn was better than mining i though
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: and you cant afk it
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: how would that be tripp?
Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: idk i read it on youtube hahah i didnt actually watch the video

Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: you can get within 30 mil per hour as well
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: i may look like a fishing main but im a farming main lamo
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: lmao
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: r eal
Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: you mushroom main lmao
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: and im actually a bz flipping main
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: yes juli but abusing pests forces you to actually stop being afk
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: you kill pests every 3 minutes
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: and need an additional armor
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: nah im just saying
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: farming got afk mode and money making mode
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: plus its more like 24m max
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: and both are decent enough
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: nah a youtuber tested it and reached 27 mil when unlucky and 33 mil when lucky
Guild > [VIP+] TheDonLover [HYDRA]: lf diana
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: did he upload the full hour with a profit tracker?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: yes
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: I dont trust numbers people claim they make, who did it?
Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: he just did his profits after the hour
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: so no timer involved?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: tbf he used t rex pet with brown bandana and full mushroom armor with pest 5
Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: not that i see
Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: so could be false
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: did he use mossy mushroom armor?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: i sincerely doubt it
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: what no
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: he switched
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: yes you farm with mossy mushroom
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: and kill with fermento
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: he used mossy fermento to farm and when pests can be spawned he swapped
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: you do it the other way around??
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: no you farm with fermento
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: no you dont
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: then when the pest timer is up
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: you switch to mushroom
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: then kill with fermento and continue farming
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: oh you mean timer for pests to spawn
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: yeah
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: no wonder you dont reach similar earning
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: i dont do it to begin with juli
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: but i know how much my friends make that are all #10 or higher in some crops lmao
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: then why say it is false
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: why swap to mushroom armor?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: bc at night stats are trippled
Guild > [VIP] 60GT [HYDRA]: at night it has a boost on its stats chun
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: so is pest chance
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: its the armor's stats
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: no?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: and you can set the time in your garden to nigh tnonstop
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: yes and pest chance counts as well
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: i know what you just sad

Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: how does that make anything better?
Guild > [VIP+] TheDonLover [HYDRA]: anyone cishing ?

Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: 3x is not much when its uncommon
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: ?
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: mossy on uncommon is only 30 farminr fortune
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: compared to fermento
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: which gives more
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: the pestchance
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: the pestchance gets trippled
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: the pest chance is not on armor?

Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: huh ? what u sayin
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: u are not getting a chim every 3 hours with 400 mf
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: u would need to get 20 of your own inq to reach the rate
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: i got 5 in 12 hours tripp got 14 in 30
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: ...
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: you can get 20 in 1 hour

Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: my chance is 1/10 of my own and then u still have ls
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: do u have 900 mf ?
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: 1/10 would mean that u have 900 combined mf
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: no

Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: cause looting
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: looting is 75 mf as u said
Guild > [MVP+] Jagwire_ [MANIAC]: no
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: it multiplies the base chance
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: no no
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: then u literally contradicted what i said
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: when i said its your total chance * mf
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: it is like 75 mf on the base and then umultipüly by looting
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: and u said no
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: ye cause it chance*looting * mf
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: yous total base chance = 1 + mf
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: i dont knwo what u on about bro lmao
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: the base chance for chimera is 1
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: then u have x mf
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: 440mf and l5 makes it 10%
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: no
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: looting doesnt give u 460 mf
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: first u have 1+=0.75
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: for looting
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: then u *mf
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: thats still not 1000
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: 460*1.75 = 7.7%
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: which is around 1/13
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: there is a command in sbo to calc
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: just use it for yourself smh
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: i mean i just did the calc with what u said
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: that would also mean u are spawning 3 of your own inq every hour (it doesnt happen)
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: you forgetting ls
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: ls just adds 1 of your own inq every 5 of your own
Guild > [MVP+] SoutifDeLuxe [MOD]: btw 460 mf is 5.6x not 4.6x
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: not exactly, but yea
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: THANKS SOUTIF
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: thats still not 1000
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: THATS WHAT I WAS MIISING
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: THATS STILL NOT 1000
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: [SBO] Chimera Chance: 9.45% (1/11) [MF:440] [L:5]
Guild > [MVP+] SoutifDeLuxe [MOD]: with 470mf or more its 10%
Guild > [MVP+] SoutifDeLuxe [MOD]: low mf ig :p
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: ye i round it to 10 from 9.5
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: lets say in a perfect scenario you are getting 370 burrows and lets say every time u somehow spawn 2 mobs every 4 burrows (never happens), u would be spawning 2.62 inq/h
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: that also assumes eman 9
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: in perfect conditions(they dont exist) u would get 1 chim every 3.8h
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: 370/h
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: you forgetting ls
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: ls from 5 people
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: is like you double your own rate
Guild > [MVP+] SoutifDeLuxe [MOD]: not really cuz looting doesnt apply on lootshare (wiki)
Guild > [MVP+] SoutifDeLuxe [MOD]: but still increase
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: thats why u always have 1 or 2 ls books less then from own
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: :)
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: u can add 1 inq to your inq count every 5 ls
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: ye and you have 5 othere people spawning inqsa
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: (obv not how it works, but lets assume u lsed 1000000000 inq)
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: and the ls inqs are a lot a lot worse
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: because no looting

Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: marina had too little perks
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: are u dumb?
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: are you really expecting a server of 12 year olds to plan ahead
Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: marinia had the important perk
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: marina would then be 4 perk next time
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: why 4?

Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: it was 2m an hour ago
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: well im estimating the prices at the end

Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: no
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: are u silly?
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: might be able to afford it if i didnt miss the spooky and jerry
Guild > [MVP+] UmItzTripp [MANIAC]: diaz minister perk isnt always the same
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: 4.5b for #10 is very reasonable?
Guild > [MVP+] chunfan [EGG]: 4b is already the fifth
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: im gonna beat whatever u put in cant lie

Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: and how do u know that?
Guild > [MVP+] julithelol [EGG]: bc i got a brain
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: ig its not big enough, because there are already new metas that are just as good/better than what we had before
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: ruby mining being nerfed, doesnt mean everything is terrible/worse now
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: well, if he abused it that hard, its deserved
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: because he obviously did it intentionally
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: yeah but u dont deserved to be wiped
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: u do
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: nah cause then u would have to wipe people who abused exotics
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: and stuff like that
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: those are not even comperable
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: black necron cp is like billions
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: and people knew what they were doing when they made those
Guild > [MVP+] FadiU [BABY]: i went off 20 minutes before black necron glitch happened z
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: still not comparable to having an item be insanely rare and then someone abusing 100% drop rate to sell tens of them
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: i was there and it was exactly like that
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: people knew they were making black necron and knew it would be worth a lot
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: thats abuse
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: litterally ah was bought out for wither armour
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: but u dont understand why they are not comparable xd
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: people sold wither chestplates for hundreds of mil
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: u dont understand that they are
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: they arent
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: how are they not then
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: explain
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: i mean they learned from there mistakes and now wiped the glitched items
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: one is using a vanilla game mechanic(dyes didint even exist) and other is abusing a 1/10000000 mechanic made 1/1 by accident
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: and its not like he did it one time
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: he knew that it shouldnt drop 100% of the time and it a bunch of times
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: people knew that it shouldnt be black necron
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: zzz w/e
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: and thats worth far more than that dye
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: u just dont understand
Guild > [MVP+] Thyla [MANIAC]: me when i make 70m an hr coring
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: its pointless
Guild > [MVP+] Thyla [MANIAC]: so happy
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: dyes literally didint exist back then
Guild > [MVP+] Ritter_desRechts [MOD]: but they didnt glicht the necron into existing yk
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: i need to core
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: also what ritter said
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: small difference from recouloring an item and dropping 10 dyes that are insanely rare 100% of the time
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: its not tho
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: w/e
Guild > [MVP+] FearNotMyCookies [MANIAC]: what are yall yapping about omg
Guild > [VIP+] MisterShaco [HYDRA]: shouldnt have abused the glitch
Guild > [MVP+] MEE6_2TRAPPY [MANIAC]: changing wither armour to black necron was abusing a glitch
